        <h2 style="margin: 5px 55px;">Abstract</h2>
        <p style="margin: 5px 55px;">
            Volunteer-collected biodiversity datasets offer immense potential for large-scale species monitoring, 
            but pose significant challenges for machine learning due to uneven sampling, biases, and 
            a high proportion of unlabeled or inconsistently labeled data. 
            Despite their scale, such real-world data defy the i.i.d. assumptions that underlie many computer vision benchmarks, 
            raising important questions about how to train reliable models for ecological applications. 
            In this work, we present two complementary experiments using DivShift-North American West Coast (DivShift-NAWC), 
            our curated dataset of almost 7.5 million volunteer-collected plant images from iNaturalist. 
            The dataset includes both labeled and unlabeled images, and is partitioned across five expert-verified axes of bias: 
            spatial, temporal, taxonomic, observer quality, and sociopolitical. 
            Our first experiment introduces Diversity Shift (DivShift), a framework for quantifying the effects of 
            domain-specific distribution shifts on machine learning model performance. 
            We compare species recognition performance across these bias partitions using a diverse variety of 
            species- and ecosystem-focused accuracy metrics. 
            We observe that these biases confound model performance less than expected from the underlying label distribution shift, and 
            that more data leads to better model performance but the magnitude of these improvements are bias-specific. 
            These findings imply that while the structure within natural world images provides generalization improvements for 
            biodiversity monitoring tasks, the biases present in volunteer-collected biodiversity data can affect model performance; 
            thus these models should be used with caution in downstream biodiversity monitoring tasks. 
            Building on this, our second experiment introduces ContextPair, a method to optimally select positive and negative pairs for 
            a contrastive plant-classification model using domain-informed context in a volunteer-collected plant image dataset. 
            To optimize the selection of positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning, 
            ContextPair runs an iterative weight-tuning algorithm on a labeled validation split, 
            learning feature weights that maximize species overlap in positive pair selection and 
            minimize species overlap in negative pair selection. 
            This allows selected pairs to reflect meaningful ecological relationships for the task of species classification, 
            improving representation learning in biodiversity datasets and downstream model performance. 
            Together, these experiments highlight two key insights. 
            First, bias-aware evaluation is essential when training models on real-world ecological dataâ€”performance may appear 
            strong overall but falter in under-sampled or marginalized regions of the data space. 
            Second, self-supervised and contrastive methods can benefit from domain-specific knowledge, 
            especially when label scarcity is a limiting factor.
